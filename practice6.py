# Write a function that given an array of integers finds the maximum sum of any contigious array  (cant skip)

fish = "halibut"

# Loop through each letter in the string
# and push to an array
letters = []

# List comprehensions provide concise syntax for creating lists

# We can also add conditional logic (if statements) to a list comprehension
